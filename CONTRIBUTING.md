# Contributing

Only members of the smoodify team will be contributing directly to this project's code. Suggestions and ideas are welcomed and encouraged, and you may contact a member of the team with this information, if you so desire. 

Please follow the code of conduct found below. Treat it as gospel when interacting with one another. 

## Process for Pull Requests

1. Before doing anything, create an Issue on GitHub to describe what you would like to do. These Issues should be as discussed in the product or sprint backlog. 
2. To begin working on an issue, create a branch named after your issue number, e.g. "#2". Make sure to include the quotes when making the branch on the terminal. Add the appropriate labels, project, and milestone to this issue and update the sprint's task board accordingly.
3. All changes should be built into your branch. When adding to the repository, please ensure that you only add the files that you made changes to. Adding all could result in someone else's commit being over written. Better yet, pull before you push. 
4. Create a pull request to the **development** branch titled after the issue number followed by a short description of what the pull request is changing, e.g. "#2 Added CONTRIBUTING.md". These wil be reviewed by other developers as well as the scrum master. Once your changes have been confirmed by the scrum master, as well as another developer, the pull request will be accepted into the development branch, the issue will be closed, and the associated branch will be deleted.
5. At the end of the sprint, the scrum master will merge the development branch with the master branch.

## Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

### Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race,
religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

### Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
  advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at [INSERT EMAIL ADDRESS]. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.
